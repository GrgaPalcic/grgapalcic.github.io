description: It's not an ideal solution, but I will try to use this to organise my notes across all the different projects.

As I often dabble in new things and always have several projects going on at the same time, an unexpected amount of time often passes between working sessions. I often end up losing notes and forgetting all the ins and outs of each project, which means I waste a lot of time digging around trying to rediscover things I've already figured out and solved.

So I decided it's time to collect all of my scattered knowledge, references, and my notes in one place in order to have them a bit better organised than they are(n't) now.

We'll see how that goes lol
