## The problem

When using STM32 CubeIDE's visual mcu configurator, and setting up sdcard to 4-bit mode code generated will look like this:

```c
/**
  * @brief SDIO Initialization Function
  * @param None
  * @retval None
  */
static void MX_SDIO_SD_Init(void)
{
  hsd.Instance = SDIO;
  hsd.Init.ClockEdge = SDIO_CLOCK_EDGE_RISING;
  hsd.Init.ClockBypass = SDIO_CLOCK_BYPASS_DISABLE;
  hsd.Init.ClockPowerSave = SDIO_CLOCK_POWER_SAVE_DISABLE;
  hsd.Init.BusWide = SDIO_BUS_WIDE_4B;    // Problem is here
  hsd.Init.HardwareFlowControl = SDIO_HARDWARE_FLOW_CONTROL_DISABLE;
  hsd.Init.ClockDiv = 6;
}
```

However, this is **incorrect.**

SD cards always power up in SDIO 1-bit mode. The host must initialise and negotiate in 1-bit first (CMD0, CMD8, ACMD41, etc.), then switch to 4-bit using ACMD6 when card is ready.

By setting 4-bit mode at initialisation stage (before card negotiation), CubeIDE causes card not to be detected. Lack of the card detection pin on this board doesn't help either.

CubeIDE auto generated code skips this requirement and applies 4-bit mode before card init.

This can be fixed by adding this code after the auto generated section:
```c
  /* USER CODE BEGIN SDIO_Init 2 */
  hsd.Init.BusWide = SDIO_BUS_WIDE_1B;
  /* USER CODE END SDIO_Init 2 */
```  

> If auto generated code is modified it will be overwriten on project regeneration. It's better to overwrite it in the user code section as it's not preserved across regenerations.
{: .prompt-info}
  

Then after successful initialisation, switch to the 4-bit mode:
```c
if (HAL_SD_ConfigWideBusOperation(&hsd, SDIO_BUS_WIDE_4B) != HAL_OK) {
  Error_Handler();
}
```

## Hardware note:

While debugging, i was using this [ STM32F407VET6 board ](https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F407VET6-STM32-F4VE-V2.0.html)

Hereâ€™s the SD card socket pinout for reference:
